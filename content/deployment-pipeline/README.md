# Deployment pipeline

Bitesize deployment pipeline has many CI/CD capabilities built to
remove mundane/tedious work from our developers. No more managing
jenkins jobs, ensuring its availability or having completely different
pipeline tools across teams. The Bitesize build pipeline removes all the cruft
but keeps everything you need to drive forward Pearson application development.

If the build pipeline is missing something you need, please reach out. The Bitesize
team is constantly innovating and we would appreciate your feedback.

You can also contribute back to this project so feel free to reach out and get
yourself added to the codebase. (Pearson Employees/Contractors)
